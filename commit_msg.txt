Fix testing keyword false positive in importance calculation

ISSUE: Bare testing keyword caused false positives
- I tested your memory with Winston got penalized
- Factual info about Winston scored importance 1
- Not embedded, could not be retrieved

FIX: Removed bare testing from penalty keywords
- Now only specific testing phrases trigger penalty
- Relies on testing memory TAG (more accurate)

IMPACT: Past tense testing references now treated as factual

Added session analysis tools
